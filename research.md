## Research at CRE Lab

The CRE Lab focuses on understanding **Cancer Resistance Evolution**,  
investigating how cancer cells adapt to therapeutic pressure through  
molecular, transcriptional, and metabolic remodeling.

Our research integrates experimental cancer biology with advanced cellular models to uncover mechanisms underlying therapy resistance.

## 🔬 Research Themes

### 1. Cancer Resistance Evolution
We study how cancer cells evolve under therapeutic pressure, focusing on adaptive strategies that enable survival and resistance to treatment.

- Evolutionary dynamics of therapy resistance  
- Transcriptional and epigenetic remodeling  
- Cellular plasticity in cancer progression  

---

### 2. Prostate Cancer Biology
Prostate cancer serves as a primary disease model in our lab.

- Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)  
- Neuroendocrine differentiation  
- Treatment-induced phenotypic switching  

---

### 3. Organoid Models and Metabolic Remodeling
We use 3D organoid systems to better recapitulate tumor architecture and microenvironment.

- Prostate cancer organoids  
- Lipid metabolism and metabolic adaptation  
- Therapy-induced metabolic rewiring  

---

## 🧬 Experimental Approaches

- 2D and 3D cancer cell culture  
- Patient-derived and cell line–derived organoids  
- Lipidomics and metabolic profiling  
- Transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses  

---

## 🧠 Long-term Goals
Our long-term goal is to identify fundamental principles governing cancer resistance evolution and to uncover vulnerabilities that can be exploited for improved therapeutic strategies.
